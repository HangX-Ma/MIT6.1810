# Lab6: Multithreading

:penguin: **ALL ASSIGNMENTS HAVE PASSED THE TESTS** :white_check_mark:

- [ ] [Uthread: switching between threads (moderate)](#1-uthread-switching-between-threads-moderate)
- [ ] [Using threads (moderate)](#2-using-threads-moderate)
- [ ] [Barrier(moderate)](#3-barriermoderate)

This lab will familiarize you with multithreading. You will implement switching between threads in a user-level threads package, use multiple threads to speed up a program, and implement a barrier.
